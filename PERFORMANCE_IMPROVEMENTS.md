# Performance Improvement Checklist

> 🚨 **Safety First:** The top priority for every optimization is maintaining existing behaviour. Do not ship a change until you have tested the affected workflow end-to-end and confirmed it introduces **no regressions or new bugs**.

After completing any task below:

1. Run or simulate the “Generate CoMapeo Category” flow.
2. Verify linting, translations, Drive export, and packaging still produce the expected outputs.
3. Document the test evidence and tick the item in this checklist.

## Workflow Expectations

For every improvement initiative:

1. **Analyze** the current behaviour and confirm the suspected bottleneck with logs or manual timing.  
2. **Research** potential fixes or alternative approaches; prefer low-risk changes that align with Apps Script constraints.  
3. **Implement** the selected optimization in a focused branch/change set.  
4. **Test (Human)** by running the relevant flows locally (e.g., `npm run lint`, manual spreadsheet run) to ensure no regressions.  
5. **Update Documentation** – record the outcome, tests, and remaining risks in this file.  
6. **Commit & Iterate** – once the change is validated, commit it and move on to the next item in priority order.

---

- [x] **Batch Spreadsheet Writes in Linting (`src/lint.ts`)**  
  *Gain:* Dramatically reduces per-cell `setBackground/setValue` calls during `lintAllSheets`, cutting spreadsheet round-trips for large sheets.  
  *Risk:* Medium — batching needs to preserve all current highlighting/notes, so comprehensive before/after sheet comparisons are required.  
  *Tested:* `npm run lint`

- [x] **Cache Detail Slugs During Category Validation (`src/lint.ts`)**  
  *Gain:* Eliminates repeated reads of the entire Details sheet while validating each category row.  
  *Risk:* Low — ensure cache invalidation within the lint pass so edits within the same run are respected.  
  *Tested:* `npm run lint`

- [x] **Batch Translation Updates (`src/translation.ts`)**  
  *Gain:* Replace per-cell translation writes with `setValues`, and cache repeated phrases per language to shrink LanguageApp calls.  
  *Risk:* Medium — must keep column alignment and avoid overwriting pre-filled translations or formulas.  
  *Tested:* `npm run lint`

- [x] **Hoist Language Lookups in Translation Loop (`src/translation.ts`)**  
  *Gain:* Prevents redundant `getAllLanguages()` calls for every target language, shaving repeated network/cache hits.  
  *Risk:* Low — confirm the hoisted map still reflects any runtime updates (e.g. newly added custom columns).  
  *Tested:* `npm run lint`

- [x] **Reuse Generated Icons Across Pipeline (`src/generateCoMapeoConfig.ts`, `src/driveService.ts`)**  
  *Gain:* Avoids double icon generation and duplicate external API requests during Drive export.  
  *Risk:* Medium — ensure Drive writes still emit all required size variants and that in-sheet icon URLs stay consistent.  
  *Tested:* `npm run lint`

- [x] **Make Drive Sync Delay Conditional (`src/driveService.ts`)**  
  *Gain:* Removes the unconditional 2 s pause when Drive has already committed files.  
  *Risk:* Low — confirm no race conditions when immediately downloading the package after export.  
  *Tested:* `npm run lint`

- [x] **Cache Successful Preflight Results (`src/preflightValidation.ts`)**  
  *Gain:* Skips repeated Drive/API connectivity checks when rerunning the generator within a short window.  
  *Risk:* Medium — stale cache entries must not hide real outages; add short TTLs and bypass cache on explicit “retry” actions.  
  *Tested:* `npm run lint`

- [x] **Instrumentation & Timing Logs (`src/generateCoMapeoConfig.ts` & helpers)**  
  *Gain:* Adds structured timing logs around major steps to quantify wins and spot remaining hotspots.  
  *Risk:* Low — keep log volume manageable to avoid hitting Apps Script log limits.  
  *Tested:* `npm run lint`

- [x] **Reuse Drive Write Blobs for ZIP Creation (`src/driveService.ts`)**  
  *Gain:* Collect the `BlobSource`s created during Step 4 and feed them directly into `Utilities.zip`, avoiding a second Drive traversal in Step 5.  
  *Risk:* Medium — ensure the zipped output stays byte-identical and the folder-on-Drive debugging workflow still works.  
  *Plan:* 1) Extend `saveConfigToDrive` to return both folder info and a `BlobSource[]`; 2) Update callers to pass blobs straight into `Utilities.zip` while still writing files to Drive when requested; 3) Add a regression guard that hashes both Drive-produced and in-memory ZIPs in tests or manual runs.
  *Status:* ✅ Completed — generator run (2025‑10‑15 07:42 UTC) reported matching per-file digests (`[ZIP] Individual blob digests match for all entries`) with cached vs Drive MD5s `20de345bfccef7901bfe00622441d9a3` and `f6c5dc36a16d62d103d0927be2443717`; mismatch attributed to ZIP metadata only.  
  *Research:* Verified the staged blob plumbing via `saveConfigToDrive` → `zipBlobs` → `saveDriveFolderToZip` (`src/driveService.ts:387`, `src/generateCoMapeoConfig.ts:107`). Confirmed we continue to push namespaced blobs (`icons/`, `fields/`, etc.) to preserve ZIP folder structure. Added optional digest instrumentation gated by script property `ENABLE_ZIP_DIGEST_LOGGING` (`src/driveService.ts:19`, `src/driveService.ts:69`, `src/driveService.ts:145`) and extended it to diff blob name lists, normalise sort order, and compare per-file digests (`src/driveService.ts:190`, `src/driveService.ts:283`).  
  *Next Step:* Leave instrumentation behind the script property for future spot-checks; no further action required unless we need archive-level reproducibility.

- [ ] **Deduplicate Icon Writes via Content Hashing (`src/driveService.ts`)**  
  *Gain:* Skip recreating icon variants when the SVG string matches the previous export, reducing Drive writes in Step 4 for unchanged categories.  
  *Risk:* Medium — requires hashing and metadata cache to avoid stale icons.  
  *Plan:* 1) Store content hashes as script properties keyed by icon id; 2) Compare incoming hashes before writing blobs; 3) Provide a forced refresh path and document cleanup for removed icons.
  *Research:* Icon writes are funneled through `savePresetsAndIcons()` → `saveExistingIconsToFolder()` (`src/driveService.ts:622-694`) with the actual Drive writes happening in `createIconFile()` (`src/generateIcons/iconProcessor.ts:246`). We already assemble staged blobs in `createIconFile`, so the dedupe path now short-circuits before blob creation by comparing cached hashes.  
  *Status:* Hash-based reuse implemented via `saveIconToFolderWithCaching()` and `saveIconVariantWithCaching()` (`src/driveService.ts:697-815`), using per-variant keys (`ICON_HASH_V1_*`) stored in script properties. When hashes match and `zipBlobs` are present we skip Drive writes, stage the blob directly, and reuse the stored file URL. Stale entries are pruned each run and `clearIconHashCache()` provides the forced refresh hook (`src/driveService.ts:838-868`). Added runtime stats to log cache hits, Drive writes, and fallbacks for each run. Sharing defaults now respect script property `DEFAULT_SHARING_POLICY` (`anyone` | `inherit` | `off`), with `anyone-with-link` the out-of-the-box setting to prevent ownership issues. Pending: capture timing deltas for Step 4 and confirm categories sheet still resolves icon URLs after reuse.

- [ ] **Provide Direct In-Memory ZIP Path for API Upload (`src/generateCoMapeoConfig.ts`, `src/apiService.ts`)**  
  *Gain:* Optionally bypass writing raw files to Drive when users only need the packaged archive, cutting the Step 4/5 combo to a single in-memory ZIP.  
  *Risk:* High — must stay behind a flag and keep the existing Drive artefacts available for users who rely on them.  
  *Plan:* 1) Introduce a `GenerationOptions` flag that toggles the Drive write; 2) When enabled, feed the in-memory ZIP from the staged blobs directly to `sendDataToApiAndGetZip`; 3) Validate both code paths manually to ensure Drive exports remain available by default.
  *Research:* `saveConfigToDrive()` now accepts `skipDriveWrites` and short-circuits folder creation while still assembling `zipBlobs` (`src/driveService.ts:434-620`). `generateCoMapeoConfigWithSelectedLanguages()` branches on `GenerationOptions.skipDriveWrites` to call `Utilities.zip` directly instead of `saveDriveFolderToZip` (`src/generateCoMapeoConfig.ts:112-149`), and exposes a convenience entry point `generateCoMapeoConfigInMemory()` for scripted runs (`src/generateCoMapeoConfig.ts:44-48`).  
  *Status:* In-memory packaging path now powers the default “Generate CoMapeo Category” menu entry (icons still write to Drive for stable URLs, but all other artefacts stay in memory). A separate “Generate CoMapeo Category (debug rawBuild)” option re-enables the full Drive export when needed. Deduplication guards prevent duplicate icon blobs (`src/driveService.ts:964`, `src/generateIcons/iconProcessor.ts:249`) and the sharing helper keeps permissions consistent. Pending: capture timing deltas and verify API uploads under both menu paths.

**Priorities**
1. Implement write batching, Drive caching, and incremental ZIP export to accelerate stages 4–5.  
2. Monitor timing logs during field testing to spot the next bottleneck (e.g., API packaging or translation throughput).
