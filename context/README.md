# Documentation Relocated

As of 2025-10-31, the reference documentation previously kept in `context/` now lives under the consolidated `docs/` tree.

- Start with [`docs/README.md`](../docs/README.md) for the new index and migration status.
- Architectural, format, and workflow references reside in [`docs/reference/`](../docs/reference/).
- Historical decision logs live in [`docs/historical/`](../docs/historical/).

This file remains only as a compatibility pointer for legacy links. Plan to remove after 2026-03-31 once all scripts and bookmarks are updated.
