# Tips and checklists

## Before you start

- Make a copy of the template spreadsheet.
- Plan categories and fields before editing.
- Decide which languages you need.
- Understand the difference between observations and tracks.

## During configuration

- Start with Categories and Details, add icons and translations later.
- Run linting after every major change.
- Use consistent, descriptive names.
- Keep the dataset small at first; expand later.

## Before generating

- Run linting and fix all errors (especially bright red).
- Verify all icons are accessible.
- Make sure at least one category includes `track`.
- Test with a small language subset first.

## After generating

- Test the config in CoMapeo immediately.
- Create a test observation for each category.
- Test a track if you have track categories.
- Verify translations and icons display correctly.

## Collaboration

- Share the spreadsheet with the right access level.
- Communicate major changes.
- Use File → Version history for rollback.
- Track versions in the Metadata sheet.
